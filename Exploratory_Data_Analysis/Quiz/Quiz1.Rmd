Some questions are so easy so not included here.
## Question 3: The answer is D (llines())

## Question 7.  
The answer is C: 
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)

I do not quite understand why "qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ factor(Month))"
does not work. They seem to be equivlent.
