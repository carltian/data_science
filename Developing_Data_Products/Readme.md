# This is a shiny application to calculate the monthly payments of a autoloan.

It takes 3 inputs: auto loan amount, how long the auto loan will be paid off in years and the yearly interest rate or APR.

The output has two parts, the first one shows the monthly payments, monthly payment interests and monthly payment principal.
The second part is a pie chart of monthly payment interests vs monthly payment principal.

At the bottom of the right pannel, it shows the number of visitors to this page using the reactivity.
